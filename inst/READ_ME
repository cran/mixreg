 Version data: 20 March 2004
 This version supecedes the version dated 6 June 2001

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 6 June 2001 consist in mildly
 re-organizing the structure of the package to make it into a package
 for R.  Running R's R CMD check on the package turned up a few
 infelicities which have been corrected.  Mostly this involved
 adjusting the documentation.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 21 July 1999 to the 
 version dated 6 June 2001 were:

	(1) In the help file for mixreg() (i.e. mixreg.d)
	the reference to the Turner paper was changed from
	``to appear'' to the appropriate reference to Applied
	Statistics.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 31 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 21 July 1999 were:

	(1) The aphids data set was adjusted to make the response
	equal to the raw counts of infected plants, rather than
	the percentage.

	The name of the response was therefore changed from
	``inf.rate'' to ``n.inf''.  This change is also reflected
	in the documentation files.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 19 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 31 October 1998 were:

	(1) The package has been adjusted slightly so that it
        can easily be installed as a section of a library.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 1 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 19 October 1998 were:

	(1) The utility function dir.sum() which was missing from
	the package is now included.
 
                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 3 September 1998 to the
 version dated 1 October 1998 were:

	(1) Functions resid.mix, plot.mresid and qq.mix are now
	included to calculate and plot appropriately residuals from
	mixtures of regressions.

	(2) The function mixreg now returns the AIC value for
	the fitted model.

	(3) The function bootcomp now takes an argument ncincr
	to enable the testing of H_0: number of components = ncomp
	versus H_1: number of components = ncomp + ncincr.

	(4) The function bootcomp now returns vectors consisting of
	an AIC value for each of the bootstrap fits that it performs.

	(5) Error trapping has been improved in the function
	bootcomp, so that a condition which previously caused it to
	crash no longer does so.

                       *****************************


 A LIBRARY SECTION OF FUNCTIONS TO COMPUTE THE FIT OF A MIXTURE OF
 REGRESSIONS TO A DATA SET, ESTIMATE THE COVARIANCE MATRIX OF THE
 PARAMETER ESTIMATES, CALCULATE CONFIDENCE AND PREDICTION BANDS IN
 THE CASE OF 1-VARIABLE REGRESSIONS, PLOT THE FIT AND CONFIDENCE
 BANDS, PLOT THE RESIDUALS, AND PERFORM BOOTSTRAP HYPOTHESIS TESTS
 REGARDING THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IN THE MIXTURE.

 The author gratefully acknowledges advice from Maureen Tingley of
 the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New
 Brunswick regarding the bootstrapping aspect of the package.
 Residual plots for mixtures of regressions are now possible due to a
 suggestion from Adrian Baddeley of the Department of Mathematics and
 Statistics, University of Western Australia.  Heberto Ghezzo of
 McGill University helpfully pointed out some bugs and lacunae in the
 package.

 Special thanks are extended to Gilles Boiteau and George Tai of the
 Potato Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,
 Fredericton, New Brunswick for bringing to the author's attention
 the problem which instigated this work and for permitting him to
 make use of their data.

 This archive contains:

	(a) This READ_ME file.
        (b) A brief file named README (no ``_'') as required to
            form a library section.

	(g) An example data set, aphids.dat.  These data appear

	    Any published work using these data should cite the paper
	    ``Rate of spread of PVY-n by alate Myzus persicae

	    conditions,'' by G. Boiteau, M. Singh, R. P. Singh,
	    G.C.C.  Tai, and T.R. Turner.  (Potato Research, vol. 41,
	    pp. 335 -- 344, 1998.)

 To get started:

	(a) Modify the `Makefile' for compatibility with your local
	    system.  In particular you may need to change the definition
	    of the SPLUS macro, depending on the name and location of the
	    Splus executable on your system.

        (b) Make sure there is a .Data directory within the directory
	    in which you are working.

	(c) Type ``make'' or ``make all'' which installs the S
	    functions and the help files.

        (d) Start an S session in whatever directory you wish to work
        in.  Issue the approprate library() command, of the form
 
        library(lib.loc=library_name,section=section_name)
 
	For example if the Mixreg package is installed as a section
	in a directory

		/home/users/melvin/mylib/mixreg

	where ``mylib'' is your personal library, then the command
	would be

	library(lib.loc="/home/users/melvin/mylib",section="mixreg")

	To avoid having to repeatedly type the longish value of the
	lib.loc string you can assign a value to lib.loc in frame 0:

	assign("lib.loc","/home/users/melvin/mylib",where=0)

	and this in turn can be done in your .First function so that
	it happens automatically whenever you start Splus in the
	given directory.  Then you can just type

	library("mixreg")

	to access this library.

	(e) Type

                   help(mixreg)
		   help(resid.mix)
                   help(plot.mresid)
		   help(qq.mix)
                   help(covmix)
                   help(cband)
                   help(plot.cband)
                   help(bootcomp)

	    to obtain instructions on how to invoke these functions,
	    and

		   help(aphids)

	    for information about the example data set.
