                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-2 12 September 2006:

 The changes from version 0.0-2 consist in fixing a bug drawn to my
 attention by Bettina Gruen. This bug involved the use of par()$uin, a
 hold-over from the Splus version of the package which does not exist
 in R.  Ms. Gruen provided a fix for the bug --- based on a function
 par.uin() --- which is now incorporated into the package.

                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-1 20 March 2004:

 The changes from the version dated 6 June 2001 consist in mildly
 re-organizing the structure of the package to make it into a package
 for R.  Running R's R CMD check on the package turned up a few
 infelicities which have been corrected.  Mostly this involved
 adjusting the documentation.

=========================================================================================
The following material relates to the old Splus version of
the package
=========================================================================================

 The changes from the version dated 21 July 1999 to the 
 version dated 6 June 2001 were:

	(1) In the help file for mixreg() (i.e. mixreg.d)
	the reference to the Turner paper was changed from
	``to appear'' to the appropriate reference to Applied
	Statistics.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 31 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 21 July 1999 were:

	(1) The aphids data set was adjusted to make the response
	equal to the raw counts of infected plants, rather than
	the percentage.

	The name of the response was therefore changed from
	``inf.rate'' to ``n.inf''.  This change is also reflected
	in the documentation files.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 19 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 31 October 1998 were:

	(1) The package has been adjusted slightly so that it
        can easily be installed as a section of a library.

                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 1 October 1998 to the 
 version dated 19 October 1998 were:

	(1) The utility function dir.sum() which was missing from
	the package is now included.
 
                       *****************************

 The changes from the version dated 3 September 1998 to the
 version dated 1 October 1998 were:

	(1) Functions resid.mix, plot.mresid and qq.mix are now
	included to calculate and plot appropriately residuals from
	mixtures of regressions.

	(2) The function mixreg now returns the AIC value for
	the fitted model.

	(3) The function bootcomp now takes an argument ncincr
	to enable the testing of H_0: number of components = ncomp
	versus H_1: number of components = ncomp + ncincr.

	(4) The function bootcomp now returns vectors consisting of
	an AIC value for each of the bootstrap fits that it performs.

	(5) Error trapping has been improved in the function
	bootcomp, so that a condition which previously caused it to
	crash no longer does so.
